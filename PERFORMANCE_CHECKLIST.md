# Performance Optimization Checklist

## âœ… Completed Optimizations

### Code Structure
- âœ… Proper React hooks usage with dependency arrays
- âœ… Memoization implemented with useMemo and useCallback  
- âœ… Context providers optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- âœ… Component structure follows React Native best practices

### Memory Management
- âœ… Local storage implementation with proper cleanup
- âœ… Voice recording cleanup after processing
- âœ… Task management with efficient state updates
- âœ… No memory leaks detected in hook implementations

### Bundle Size
- âœ… Tree-shaking enabled for unused exports
- âœ… No unnecessary large dependencies
- âœ… Efficient asset management
- âœ… SVG assets used for scalability

## ðŸ”„ Areas to Monitor

### Runtime Performance
- React DevTools Profiler recommended for production monitoring
- Task rendering performance with large datasets (100+ tasks)
- Voice processing latency on slower devices
- RTL layout switching performance

### Network Usage
- Currently all data is local (no network requests)
- Voice processing is local (no API calls)

## ðŸ“Š Recommended Testing

### Real Device Testing
1. Test on older Android devices (API 21+)
2. Test on various iOS versions (iOS 11+)
3. Test with Arabic text rendering on different devices
4. Test voice recording on devices with different microphone quality

### Performance Metrics to Track
- App startup time
- Task creation/edit response time
- Memory usage during extended sessions
- Battery usage during voice recording

## ðŸš€ Future Optimizations

### If Needed
- Virtualization for very large task lists (100+)
- Lazy loading for complex components
- Image optimization for custom task colors
- Background task processing optimization

## âœ… App Store Readiness
- No performance blockers identified
- Memory usage within reasonable limits
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Proper cleanup of resources
